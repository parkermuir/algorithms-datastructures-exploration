/*
Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

Note:

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
Example 1:

Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [1, 7],
  [1, 2, 5],
  [2, 6],
  [1, 1, 6]
]
Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5,
A solution set is:
[
  [1,2,2],
  [5]
]

/*
III

Find all possible combinations of k numbers that add up to a number n, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.

Note:

All numbers will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
Example 1:

Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]
Example 2:

Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]
